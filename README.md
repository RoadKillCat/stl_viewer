[stl viewer](https://joeiddon.github.io/stl_viewer)
=========

A simple client-side web app to view `.stl` files.

Click on the title link to visit it - there are instructions on the first screen on how to use it.

If you would like a `.stl` file to test it on, may I recommend [this file of a pikachu (20kb)](https://github.com/joeiddon/stl_viewer/raw/master/pikachu_test.stl).

The source for the pikachu can be found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:376601).
